## Steps to use it
- clone the given repository locally
- Create a database and a user in mysql and grant all priviledge to it
- set environment variables so that application.properties can pick up the variables
- open the project in intellij and load all the maven dependency
- run the application

- swagger documentation can be found on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
- in database you need to add initial client

## Note : Overall authentication is not working right now it will take some time
- right now I'm looking how to implement oauth for monolithic app
- since previously I made this for microservices, currently I'm unable to simply implement that
